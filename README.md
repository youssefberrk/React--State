# React Class-Based Component Project

## 📖 Description
In this project, we are going to create our **first class-based component** and also our **first state** in React.  
This exercise helps understand how to manage state, toggle UI elements, and use lifecycle methods.

## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **Create a project using `create-react-app`:**

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
````

2. **Transform `App.js` into a class-based component.**

3. **Implement a state** in the class containing:

   ```js
   Person = {
     fullName,
     bio,
     imgSrc,
     profession
   }
   ```

   and a boolean `shows`.

4. **Add a button** that toggles the `shows` state.

   * When `shows` is `true`, the person's profile will appear.

5. **Create a field** that displays the **time interval** since the component was last mounted, using the **component lifecycle**.

   * Hint: use the `setInterval` method.
